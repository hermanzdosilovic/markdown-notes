#Markdown Notes

This is the official repository for [Markdown Notes](http://markdownnotes.com).

##Application overview

Markdown Notes is a note-taking application that uses Markdown, LaTeX and Graphviz. You can see the application on the [Markdown Notes](http://markdownnotes.com) website.

##Architecture overview

Markdown Notes is a Django application with an AngularJS front-end.

**The back-end** consists of a simple Tastypie API to serve the notes and a bunch of simple Django views to handle the front page and user management. File uploads are stored on Amazon S3.

**The front-end** consists of an AngularJS app that binds various libraries together. The front-end code can be found in `/frontend`.

##Setting up the project

1. Install all requirements with pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Install the external libraries with `bower install`
3. Rename `markdown_notes/local_settings.py.template` and update it with your own settings. Some values in `settings.py` need to be set in environment variables.
4. Collect the static files with `python manage.py collectstatic`. When `DEBUG = False`, you will also need to call `python manage.py compress`.
5. Create the database with `python manage.py migrate`.
6. Run the server with `python manage.py runserver`.

###Deployment tools

A crude tool for automatic deployments is available. Install `forever` (`npm install -g forever`) and run `forever start webhooks.js` to have the server redeploy every time there is activity on the GitHub repo.

`deploy.sh` will pull code from the git repository, sync the database, collect static files and minimize them before restarting the server. It is used by `webhooks.js`, but can also be called manually.
